# Happy Learning

> Use [npmJS](https://www.npmjs.com/) to explore modules  
> and follow [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/)  

Whenever you don't find a node_module folder, all you need to do is run
```bash
npm install
```
and all the required dependencies will be installed on the fly via package.json file.  
```bash
npm install nodemon -g
```
Will install nodemon _globally_.
